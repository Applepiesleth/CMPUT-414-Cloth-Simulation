Included Files:
* assignment3.html
* assignment3.js - Contains initialization and changeRotation()
* square.js - Contains square class

NOTES:
* The constant variable `mode` in assignment3.js allows user to switch between
  the cube generated up to step 10 (mode = 1) and the cube in step 11 (mode = 2) 

* Change in degrees is determined by change in x mouse position in window.
  Thus, the box may quickly close when moving the mouse into window as the first
  change in x is determined for the left side of the window.

* x and y positions passed to the square class are in reference to
  change from the parent square (or for squares with no parent, the
  origin)

* Added functionality to change eye x coordinates using left and right
  arrow keys.
